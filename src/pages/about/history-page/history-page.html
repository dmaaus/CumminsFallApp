      <p>Cummins Falls’ rich history includes a time when Indians used the area to track the numerous buffalo that wallowed in the river’s shallow areas. In the 1790s, Sergeant Blackburn, a veteran of the Revolutionary War and for whom the Blackburn Fork State Scenic River was named, was awarded the land in lieu of a pension. The land was acquired by John Cummins in 1825, and he used the land to build the first of two mills. Because of his growing clientele, a larger second mill was built in 1845. Local residents would visit the mills and the falls for both commerce and recreation.</p>
      <p>The mill was washed away during the great flood of 1928, but cars and paved highways had already begun to make
         the trek to Cummins Falls more accessible. The land was not rebuilt, but stayed with the Cummins family for more
         than 180 years until efforts by the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation to purchase the land through private
         and public donations for resale to the state of Tennessee.The park bears the Cummins name, though <br/>
          it is commonly mis-spelled "Cummings".</p>
