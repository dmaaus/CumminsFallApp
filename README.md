## This is the capstone project at Tennessee Tech University. The mobile app will provide information about the park such as weather, events, history, open hours, etc. It also allow park ranger to login and send out notification about park closure to people who are in a certain range of the park. 

The file structure of this project is similar to other Ionic projects. `node_modules` contains all of the plugins this project uses. `platforms` contains build artifacts specific to each platform. `src` contains the real code. `src/app` contains the main code related to installed modules and app setup. The remainder of the folders in `src` contain what you would expect. `config.xml` and `package.json` both contain important bookkeeping information.
