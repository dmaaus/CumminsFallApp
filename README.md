#Cummins Falls Park Project

The Cummins Falls Park Project is a project by Anh Dao, Connor Gannon, Jon McClung, Samuel O'Neal, and Mason Stookesbury. This is a multi-component project. The first and most important component is a system for counting the number of visitors Cummins Falls receives each day. The system should be able to distinguish between unique visitors without storing information that would violate the visitorsâ€™ privacy. Multiple visits from the same person in one day are considered one visit. Multiple visits from the same person on two different days are considered two visits. The second component is a mobile application. This primary purpose of this application is to provide flood warnings to visitors of the park. The secondary purpose is to provide general information about the park to visitors.
