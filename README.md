# Cummins Falls Park Project

## Anh Dao, Connor Gannon, Jon McClung, Samuel O'Neal, and Mason Stooksbury

The file structure of this project is similar to other Ionic projects. `node_modules` contains all of the plugins this project uses. `platforms` contains build artifacts specific to each platform. `src` contains the real code. `src/app` contains the main code related to installed modules and app setup. The remainder of the folders in `src` contain what you would expect. `config.xml` and `package.json` both contain important bookkeeping information.
